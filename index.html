            <p>
              Unlike statements from the White House press room, people actually
              tune in. By the tens of millions, Americans listen to a calculated
              speech, occasionally interrupted by lopsided standing ovations.
              <br /><br />
              I'm one of those Americans. I watch. I listen. I try and hang on
              'til the end but never make it because it's a Hallmark movie where
              the characters aren't hot. The SOTU is predictable and highly
              scripted, where every conflict has a clear resolution. So I set
              out to look at

              them. <br /><br />The first looks at the
              <span class="highlight-yellow">maturity</span> of their language,
              or what age groups could understand their speeches. The second
              measures language that projects

                >excitement, power, and abstraction</span
              >. The third is all about
              <span class="highlight-green">politicization</span>, i.e.
              politically provocative language.

            <p>
              A couple hundred years ago, the State of the Union was one
              powdered wig talking to a room of powdered wigs. More than half
              the room still believed that only property-owning guys that use
              words like "sagacity" and "condign" deserve power. <br /><br />As
              you'll see
              <a
                href="https://github.com/joshstrupp-dot-com/SOTU/blob/main/charts/Reading%20level%20accessibility%20over%20time.png"
                target="_blank"
                >immature language increases as America matures</a
              >. It makes sense that once radio hit the airwaves, the language
              Presidents used no longer required three degrees and a deep
              understanding of Voltaire. They spoke to everyone.
              <br /><br />There are a two anomalies. First, despite being the
              first president to speak to a national audience via satellite,
              <span class="highlight-yellow">Jimmy Carter's</span> language was
              about as intelligible as
              <span class="highlight-yellow">George Washington's</span>. Perhaps
              when addressing congress, Jimmy's soil-tilling roots were subdued.
              <br /><br />Second,
              <span class="highlight-yellow">Chester A. Arthur</span>
              (1881-1885), nicknamed "The Gentleman Boss," addressed the nation
              with the most advanced vocabulary of any president. Curiously, his
              successor <span class="highlight-yellow">Grover Cleveland</span> —
              the first Democrat to be elected after the Civil War and nicknamed
              "Grover the Good" — spoke with the least advanced vocabulary of
              any president. Perhaps this was an attempt to appeal to broader
              constituencies, or a direct repudiation of The Gentlemen Boss.

            <p>
              Since Y2K, Presidents deployed crystal clear language (i.e. high
              "concreteness") at the SOTU. Instead of "mechanized beasts
              bridging distances with cargo,"
              <span class="highlight-orange">Trump, Biden, Obama, and GWB</span>
              say "truck." Low concept. High reality. <br /><br />Oddly, this
              wasn't the only stretch in history where concrete language
              prevailed over abstraction. From the onset of the civil war up
              through WWI, things were incredibly nonconceptual — time to talk
              in military, not heady, parlance. Guns are guns. Foes are foes.
              To. The. Point. <br /><br />But

              To communicate big ideas like international diplomacy and social
              welfare programs, abstract language was needed. <br /><br />Words
              that evoke power and excitement follow a similar trend, with some
              notable exceptions: likely due to 9/11,
              <span class="highlight-orange">George W. Bush</span>'s language,
              infused with overtones of conquest and revenge, ranks ahead of the
              rest in "dominance" and "arousal." Among the lowest in these
              categories:
              <span class="highlight-orange">Dwight Eisenhower</span>, who had
              the pleasure of overseeing an America fresh from a WWII victory
              and entering an era of peace. Or so he said.

              could make the argument that both Roosevelts faced major crises

              WWII), prompting stronger language. <br /><br />You could say the

              H.W. Bush) and the War on Terror (Dubya), leading to more charged

              Donald Trump is a president defined (mostly) by his speech. The
              way he addresses the public carries a tone and attitude that
              communicates something his words don't. And whatever it is, a
              narrow majority loves it. <br /><br />Donald's SOTU ratings are
              better than Biden's, but still lesser than George W. Bush and Bill
              Clinton. Don't tell him. So if you do tune in, consider the
